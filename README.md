Basic introductory programs I wrote while learning go and some helpful notes

## Notes on Go

### Overview
- Go is based mostly on C and influenced by other languages (C++, Java, C#, etc.)
- Go implements many OOP concepts such as encapsulation with types and structs, polymorphism with interfaces etc.
- Go does not support type inheritance
- Go is a compiled language and it is statically typed however the Go tool can run a file without precompiling
- There is no external VM like JVM so run time must be included in the compiled code
- Go has some object-oriented features but there is no inheritance, classes, overloading, structured exception handling (no try, catch etc), implicit numeric conversions etc. This was done to improve readability.
